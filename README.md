# UdacityAdventureGame
This is the code for the Udacity Intro to Programming ND - Adventure Game Written in Python.

I got two issues going on, one is that I have a consistant villain everytime I run the code, the only thing is that when i restart it, it dosen't grab a new villain, 
not sure how to handle that problem.

the second is that I have Pycodestyle installed on my computer, and I checked it multiple times with my code, and it dosen't pull any errors, and I pasted my code into 
http://pep8online.com/ and it doesn't pull any errors, so im not sure what to do on this issue?
